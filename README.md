# Python implementation of paper and project http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/project/text-deblur/

The code was written by a team:
Iaroslav Koshelev,
Pavel Lakidon,
Ivan Matvienko,
Elizaveta Perchenko,
as a part of NLA-2018 course at Skoltech (https://github.com/oseledets/nla2018.git).

## Getting Started
Just examine the paper and start experiments! Run 'python apply.py -h' to see how to parse parameters. To run the simple text deblurring demo, just run 'python apply.py'!
